My name is WU Jiqing.
My hometown is GuAn county of Hebei province.
I was born in 1980.
In 1998, I was admitted to LangFang army missile institute, thus I joined army.
After I graduated from LangFang, I went to National University of Defense Technology
for my master degree.
At the end of 2004, I achieved my Master degree in Computer science and technology.
And I began study for my doctorate in the same place since April, 2005.
Finally, I received my doctor degree in 2011.
Then I was dispatched to a army unit in Henan province.
but I could not apply my knowledge in my work.
So I chose to take off my uniform at the end of 2013.
In March, 2014, I went to Beijing, and joined
Asia Pacific East communication network Co. Ltd. as an advanced technology manager.
I like the feel that "I made it", I can not get fulfilled there without enough developing work.
So I come. That's all.
