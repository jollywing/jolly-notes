Author: Adam Dachis

I've long been overwhelmed by an unwieldy list of goals that would sit, unaccomplished, in a long-term to-do list year after year. Then I came across a simple trick that solved my chronic (长期的) problem. As gimmicky as it may sound, *I'm now accomplishing everything I'd been putting off in just an hour a day.* Here's how you can, too.

I exercise every day. My apartment is always neat and tidy. I've finished more projects in the last 60 days than I have in the entirety of 2011. I did all of this with very little effort. How? I finally decided to give Jerry Seinfeld's productivity secret a try. It's more commonly known as "Don't Break the Chain," and the concept is simple: spend some amount of time doing a desired activity every day and, when you do, cross off that day on a calendar. This creates a chain of Xs showing your progress. If you don't do your specified task on one day, you don't get an X and that chain is broken. It seems almost too simple to work, but it's allowed me to accomplish so much more than I ever thought possible.

That said, the concept wasn't perfect for me and it didn't account for things like sick days and vacations. The trick assumes you have one goal and never take a break. I wanted to exercise, keep my apartment clean, handle chores more responsibly, work on various development projects, and write screenplays, but not every single day for the rest of my life. Originally, I looked at my schedule and realized there was only about an hour per day I could devote to any of these tasks while still enjoying a social life and maintaining my sanity. That did not seem like enough time to do anything, so I gave up. But then, for some reason, "Don't Break the Chain" started inadvertently appearing in web searches and email messages. I'd heard about it but never really bothered to find out what it was or how it worked.
*When I finally looked, I realized that if I devoted 15 minutes per day to each one of my desired tasks I'd make some progress, and that would be better than no progress at all.*
Besides, *practicing multiple skills at once* is supposed to be good for you. I figured, what's the harm?

I decided to start with three goals to try it out and so I put three calendars on the wall for the month of December. I marked one Writing, one Exercise, and one Cleaning. After a week I'd written about 30 pages, done 700 push ups and 980 sit ups, jogged several miles, and my apartment was as clean as a catalog photo. Everything was easy, my progress was visible, and my tasks started to become addictive.

Now that you know the broad story and what can be accomplished, let's talk about how this works.

## The Process, Step by Step ##

The entire process is remarkably easy and you can get everything ready in about 15 to 30 minutes.
We'll go over each step in detail, but here's the general outline:

- Figure out your goals. Start with no more than three, and add a fourth goal after three weeks if you can handle it.
- Set daily minimums for each goal. Things like "I will run one mile" or "I will put away 10 stray items" work better than setting a time limit.
- Set your boundaries and rules. Because this process expects you to work every single day, you have to figure out what you're going to do when you're sick, on vacation, or just find yourself in a situation where you won't be accomplishing your goal that day but don't deserve the punishment of a broken chain.
- Print out a calendar for each goal and label it with that goal. I prefer a series of monthly calendars because there's more room to make a big X, but traditionally "Don't Break the Chain" uses one year-long calendar. Either way, put these calendars up on your wall where you'll see them regularly.
- Buy a fat red marker, or any marker—the fat ones just make bigger and more rewarding Xs.

## Step One: Choose Your Goals ##

When you're selecting your goals, I've found it helps to start broadly.
When I first began I wanted to write a very specific screenplay, but I knew I'd finish it and move on to something else. As a result, I simply made writing a goal. Additionally, your exercise routine shouldn't be the same every day or you won't get enough variation, so I made exercise another broad goal. Basically, don't be too specific when you're deciding what you want to do. You can define your projects as you go. The important thing is that you pick categories that includes many projects so you always have something to do. I found that I ran out of cleaning tasks very quickly, so I needed to expand my cleaning goal to chores in general. Everything is up to you, so you can adjust your process as needed.

## Step Two: Set Your Minimums ##

Now that you have goals, you need to figure out the minimum amount of work you're required to accomplish each day in order to earn your X on the calendar. Because I only had an hour to spare, I had to keep my tasks to 15 minutes each. Telling yourself you have 15 minutes to work on something doesn't provide you with tangible accomplishments, however, so I recommend setting very simple goals that seem like a little but add up to a lot very quickly. Here's what I came up with:

- Cleaning: Do one chore per day. For example, put away 10 stray items, vacuum, take out the trash and put in a new trash bag, clean the counter tops, and so on. Pick one, do it.
- Exercise: Do a portion of your exercise routine each day. Go for a jog or walk, plus push ups, sit ups, free weights, or another targeted exercise. Do as many repetitions as possible and take no breaks. (This amounts to 15-20 minutes of exercise, which is really all you need to get reasonably fit.)
- Writing: Write one page per day, or revise three pages of existing writing.
- Development: Complete one specific task on your development list. This may mean styling an element in CSS, writing a new function, or fixing a bug.

The idea is to essentially capture a task that you can easily accomplish within a given time frame. With things like exercise, you'll probably always use up the total allotted time because as you get stronger and faster you'll need to work harder to continue to get better. With things like cleaning, however, taking out the trash only takes a few minutes and scrubbing the toilet can take a bit longer. Some days may be a little longer and some a little shorter, but it all evens out in the end.

## Step Three: Set Your Boundaries ##

It's unrealistic to expect yourself to work on all your goals every day for the rest of your life. Sometimes you get sick and sometimes you need a break. That said, it just feels wrong to put an X on a day where you did nothing. It also feels wrong to break the chain for a reason beyond your control or for a hard-earned vacation. If you think of this process like a mini-job, however, the solution is simple: time off benefits.

When you're sick and can't perform your duties, put an S instead of an X on that day. If you're on vacation and cannot or do not want to perform you duties, put a V on that day. How many days do you get off? I just use the same rules as my job: three weeks per year including sick days. You can follow the same benefits you get at work or just use the standard allotment: 15 vacation days and six sick days. Your days off get reset at the end of every year, and if you start after the first of the year you should prorate the number. As for weekends, you can decide if you want to take those off or not. Personally, I find the weekends to be the best days to work because I have so much time. I prefer to work every day because the commitment is so small and it helps build better habits, but you should set rules for yourself that work best for your life.

Since starting this process, I've taken one trip, gotten something like the flu, and hurt my arm. None of these problems prevented me from working on my goals every single day. When I was on the trip I couldn't clean my house so instead I cleaned where I was staying to help out. I also spent one day sorting the mail and another day getting my car washed. When I hurt my arm, I simply did other exercises until it felt better. When I was under the weather, I just sucked it up and worked anyway. I don't necessarily recommend this, but I've come to love this process so much that I wasn't going to let fatigue and difficulty breathing stop me from getting things done. (I wish I was kidding.)

## Step Four: Print Your Calendars ##

Once you've got a plan together, you're going to need calendars to keep track of your progress. You can buy one, or you can just print them for free. I used iCal to print mine because I like the way they look, but you can easily grab free, printable calendars from Print Free. Monthly calendars take up a lot of room on the wall, so you may prefer to print out a year instead. "Don't Break the Chain" traditionally uses a single page year-long calendar, but I like seeing my progress in large form. Choose the type that works best for you.

## Step Five: Get a Big, Fat Marker ##

Silly, yes, but this is also the fun part. Getting a big, fat marker doesn't require much additional explanation, but there are a couple of things to add. First, you want to avoid anything that's going to run through paper so permanent markers like this one are not a good choice. (That is, unless you print your calendars on very thick paper.) Instead, I recommend picking up a pack of Crayola Broad Point Markers. You get eight for less than the cost of a permanent marker. Also, you may want to pick up some Industrial Strength Adhesive Velcro. Velcro comes in handy in life (especially for tablet owners) but it's also a simple way to stick your marker on the wall besides your calendars so it's always available to cross off a day.

## Ready, Set, Go! ##

You're done getting everything together and you can start right now. But if not right now, then tomorrow. Whatever you do, don't plan to start on a distant day. Your plan should be so easy that very little can get in the way of your daily progress, so if you're not ready to start tomorrow then you need to go back and figure out how to make your plan simple enough to do so. This process works because it creates good work habits, doesn't require much of you, demonstrates your progress visually every day, and makes you feel incredibly accomplished and productive despite only working for a short period of time. It's easy, it's fun, and if it's something you want to do you should do it now. There's no reason to wait.

## Comments ##

I love lists - I use Things and my lists are synced across ipad, ipod, macbook and macpro - i know, I know. I hear this new app Clear is very good and much cheaper, but I haven't tried it.

2 things that help make and keep me productive

a) I keep a long list and a short list, and each morning I make a short list for the day from items in the long list. All new things (unless urgent) go on the long list.

b) I make bite sized tasks so they don't look insurmountable. I won't for example write - "make restaurant web site" - instead, I'll make a few tasks like "create front page of web site" and "design inside page of web site".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you use Things on the Mac? I looked the reviews for the iPad version and there are a ton of negatives on the front page. Also, Clear seems too simplistic, and also has a bunch of negatives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I do - there are also a bunch of negatives on the ios versions. One of the main complaints is that the syncing is clunky - you have to run the app on all synd devices simultaneously for them to sync. They're working on cloud enabled beta which will solve a LOT of problems for everyone. I'm quite psyched about it. I haven't tried Clear, I just heard about it recently. As you must be aware, nothing is going to be perfect, but so far I'm quite pleased with Things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but using this technique I finally, at nearly age 30, floss regularly. It's something I always knew I should do, but now it's actually in mind at night. Gotta be able to highlight today as complete on the calendar, or I'll see how gross I am next time I look at it :D

I've also used it on other things. I count a task as completed for the day even if I only spend a few short minutes on it, because a few short minutes is *MUCH* better than waiting till tomorrow, when I'll just procrastinate again. A few minutes each day (and more time when I've actually got time), and you start to see real progress in your life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Mitch Hedberg said,

"People who smoke cigarettes, they say "You don't know how hard it is to quit smoking." Yes I do. It's as hard as it is to start flossing."

LOL...never heard that one before!

Like any habit, you'll do it when you finally *decide* to do it. If you talk to people who've changed themselves significantly (i.e. quit smoking/drinking/bad drug habit, started working out/school, etc), when it comes down to how they started it's always that they finally really decided to change.

It's not an easy thing to do, but without that deep, internal commitment to change, it's all just surface actions. I have my own habits I keep *saying* I want to change...but until I have that commitment to it, I know it ain't gonna happen!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started flossing regularly after getting a whiff of the floss after I flossed. It. Was. Disgusting. What's that smell? Oh, it's just leftover putrid food rotting in your mouth! Never had a problem flossing after that!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Jerry Seinfeld secret was the the post that led me to Lifehacker in the first place; it's simple but effective. I'm not sure if writing for only 15 mins is going to achieve anything of merit but I like the idea of building in days off into my chain as there's nothing more off-putting than a broken chain.

I tried the streaks app but I find it's nice to have an immediate visual reminder where I write, rather than an app on my iPhone which will led me towards checking my email, twitter feed, play angry birds etc. Plus if you lose or reset your phone, you lose your record of progress for the year.

The Pomodoro technique works well with Jerry's secret too. I'd be interested to hear if others use this successfully here.

Seinfeld and Pomodoro both work very well. I would say the most important thing is to be able to keep up with them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writing for 15 minutes may not feel like it's producing much content, but you'll be surprised what happens. You'll develop the ability to "switch on" your writing mode easier and easier and then go for longer times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've tried this before, but apparently I care more about procrastinating than red X's. Turns out this doesn't work if you just don't give a shit about a not breaking the chain LOL. Maybe I'll try again, though. Great article.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Touché! I thought the exact same thing as I'm terrible with managing my time. If only Lydia would quest with me irl I could get more productive things done!

Also doesn't work if you have a life that can't be planned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the don't break the chain method. I have been using it with my kids to encourage them to do their chores around the house without me having to remind and/or cajole them all the time.

I gave each one a calendar. It's a monthly calendar with a space on the side for listing the chores they are responsible for. Each day, they are to spend 20 minutes doing those chores. It doesn't matter which chores they choose each day, as long as they're doing something on the list. I structured the chores so that within a week they'd get to all of them. Each day they do it they get to put an X on the calendar.

And the extra incentive for the kids is that they get some sort of reward for unbroken chains. The longer the chain before it's broken, the bigger the reward.

My kids are 12 and 15, but I also shared the trick with my brother, whose kids are 5 and 7, and it works for the younger kids, too. You just have to adjust the chores and rewards to be appropriate for the age.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not a fan of "don't break the chain", especially for exercise. If you work out hard your body needs rest days to rebuild muscle. I run 3 times a week and lift twice and don't see any advantage to working out those other 2 days.

For cleaning I came up with a different game, I try to clean 28 areas a month. If I miss a day during the week I can do extra on the weekends. The point is when I hit 28 I relax guilt-free the remaining days of the month. I've come to the conclusion that if I set too many goals for myself I just feel bad when I want to watch tv or play video games for an evening.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could just X off your off days, because missing them isn't breaking the chain, it's part of the work (building muscle). Or one could just do some cardio, daily cardio is supposedly good - you don't need a break from that. Resting only applies to muscle building exercises.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are already working out 5 days a week then you don't need this to keep you motivated. basically, this isn't for you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are plenty of ways to customize the principle. You could get some graph paper and add your scheduled dates to the top margin of each square in a row, creating a "progress bar"; or just make a spreadsheet. The boxes or cells would be contiguous, providing a visual "chain," but the dates would be staggered according to your needs (e.g. 3/1/12, 3/3/12, etc.). Or you could just do what jryan727 said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not a fan?

If you are able to go to the gym 5 days a week, week after week and don't have a problem sticking that routine, then you don't need the "don't break the chain" system for it. Use it for activities you put off, not the ones you have no problem accomplishing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What if the one thing you want to do every day is something huge like "I will put in 8 hours a day of work at my from-home freelancing job"? It's a lot bigger challenge than fifteen minutes here or there. I've been trying to make this work for me, but it's so easy to fail a day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're trying to fill a time quota - like working for 8 full hours - then keep a stopwatch or timer and have it run while you are actually doing work, but not running when you take a break or do something else. At then end of the day, write down how many hours and minutes you spent on your activity. If you get to 8 hours, then put a big X on the calendar. If you don't get to 8 hours, then write down the time you spent on your activity on the calendar instead. That way, rather than seeing the commitment aspect as simply pass/fail, you've added degrees of succeeding.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try the Pomodoro technique. It was posted on Lifehacker awhile ago. Part of the difficulty of such a large task is that it's overwhelming and tempting to just not start. Better to break it up into smaller, manageable tasks. The technique can help with that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been doing something similar since start of new year. Not as Draconian as the "never miss a day" but made a list of daily goals and am checking them off daily. Very satisfying and effective. I've been using it to develop a meditation practice, stay accountable on personal projects, Omega-3s, keeping a gratitude journal and such.

Combining it with an LH tip from earlier in the year, perhaps from Alan Henry, of planning my days the night before. Very, very helpful.

Love adding "V" for vacation - had no system for tracking days I was deliberately taking off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another "chain" you could use is a class register. In school my teachers had registers with a list of dates at the top (across, dates written vertically) and names down the side, on day 1 when you were present you got a / and on day 2 you got a \. If you were absent you got a O in red. What makes this better is you write the dates in yourself so you can allow for vacations and sick days without breaking the chain. ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried this once a few years ago, after I saw it here, I think. Anyway, I found that getting started is, as always, the hardest part. You don't feel bad about breaking a chain that's only 2 days long! I need to try this again, as there are a few things I need to start doing daily to improve myself.

Glad to hear it is working out so well for ya.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do this to motivate myself to work out, with an added monetary bonus. I put a smiley face sticker on my calendar every day I work out. At the end of the month, how ever many smileys I have equals the number of dollars I have for something completely superfluous. Last month and this month are teaming up to buy the play "Starship" on DVD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reason that I think this works, is because it develops our sense of creating a rewarding habit. As described in this interesting article from the NY Times regarding Habit formation and how Retailers figure out how to best market products to us;

[www.nytimes.com]

Basically, it comes down to creating a habit loop, consisting of a cue, a routine and a reward.

To reference the article: "When you finish making a bed (cue), spritz Febreze (routine) and breathe a sweet, contented sigh (reward)."

In LH article, the cue's seem to be the time(15 minutes after work at x:xx time)/actions preceding the urge(after cleaning then exercise), the routine is the actual activity you are performing(cleaning, exercise) and the reward is the crossing of the X on the calendar.

I definitely recommend using the above methodology. I use this to motivate myself to read and exercise, but find that drawing a vertical line on a calendar day, connecting one day to another, seems to have more continuity to it than drawing an X, I feel that it provides more of a visual continuity than an X.

Either way, this technique does work, I hope that people will try it out to improve their own lives in any way possible.

Schedule some time in your busy life to help some other people, like your family or friends. Not only will they appreciate it, you will as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could also tie rewards into the system beyond just the X. I use it for my kids and chores. The longer the unbroken chain, the bigger the reward.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've done this for a long time myself, but simply using an excel spreadsheet. Less to futz with, and as long as I keep the shortcut right in the center of my desktop, I never forget.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very cool idea. I'm going to think about whether I have three things I want to accomplish and an extra hour.

Is anyone, like me, procrastinating at work / chores by reading this article?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

whenever I read anything on productivity or better time use I'm pretty much always taking a break from what I should be doing. Its a bit funny that way

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Streaks is a cool iPhone app which does this.

I tried Streaks. I think having it on the wall makes all the difference. It looks you in the face all the time. It is easy to ignore an app. You need to open it to feel bad about not doing something.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have problems getting motivated to clean? Tried-and-true solutions:

1. Invite people over for a meal.

2. Start giving lessons out of your home.

3. Start babysitting a baby who loves to clean. Take baby home. Baby will begin pointing at the washer and asking for it to "make splash noise." Ok, sure, why not, load the washer and have baby push appropriate buttons. Baby will grab your broom and laugh hysterically; ok, sure you start to sweep while the baby toddles after you and laughs. That wasn't so hard! By now, you're motivated. Play peek-a-boo with baby while changing the sheets. Have baby help you dust. When the wash is done, have baby hand you clothespins, saying "snap-snap!" to keep baby entertained as you hang up the wash. Put a bit of water in a small bucket and give baby a dishrag and plastic bowl. Baby will happily "splash-splash" the bowl while you do the rest of the dishes.

Seriously, the kid is more adorable than you could even imagine and is going to grow up to be a professional motivator!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Works with Google Calendar, too! I Just created a couple of new calendars for projects, gave each one a nice flashy color, and every time I want to "mark an x", I just create an all-day event for that day! :) Thanks for the great article!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this method to stop drinking [Coke...and] it worked. Now, I think I'll try adding something in as a new (good) habit. I only had to use the chart/chain for about 5 weeks before I was off Coke completely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the features I like in the Goal Master app I mentioned earlie in the thread is that it allows you do set "positive" and "negative" goals, so you can give yourself credit for things you did or didn't do. With a negative goal, like avoiding coffee, you just tick off when you've made it through the day without coffee. Naturally, there's no reason you couldn't do the same with a wall calendar, digital calendar or spreadsheet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree that the Seinfeld hack (don't break the chain) can be incredibly powerful — but only once you have a long chain to not break. So there's a catch-22 until then — you can sometimes keep failing again and again indefinitely, never building up the motivating chain. And that problem repeats every time the chain breaks. So you're always in a precarious situation where one bad day can precipitate many more bad days, where you go down a slippery slope of "one more day won't hurt; I'll get a new chain started tomorrow".

(Extreme bias warning) With Beeminder you can commit to maintaining a certain average, like 3 posts per week. So it's not all-or-nothing like the Seinfeld hack. Beeminder's "stay on the yellow brick road" is similar to Seinfeld's (or habitforge's) "don't break the chain" but it's much more flexible. Like you can build up a safety buffer and then take some time off, without the danger that that will lead you down a slippery slope of sloth. With Beeminder's yellow brick road you've precommitted to not let your overall average dip too far.

If the rate you want to maintain is exactly 7 per week — 6.9 is unacceptable — and if you can sustain that long term, then "don't break the chain" is probably perfect. For everything else, there's Beeminder!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pretty excited by this idea. However I'm working on adapting it somewhat to suit my favourite productivity tools:

1. Put everything I want to do into your favorite task application (I use gmail. The calendar view has a very nice task app that sync's nicely to iphone (GeeTasks)/android (GTasks). In there I have categories/projects like you exercise/cleaning etc

2. Create a calendar for your time (I use gmail) and put your time to spend in there - eg exercise first thing every morning, cleaning 15 mins after dinner everynight and so on. This cal happens to be green for me.

3. Create an additional calendar and call it Done or Complete - what ever floats your boat - this calendar happens to be blue in my tools.

4. As you complete each task, switch it from Your calendar to the Done calendar - in my case this is blueing it out as opposed to your red crayola.

I think this follows the same method, is easy for me to reference where ever I am work/home/walking. You can and should print out the calendar and post it on your wall to re-enforce that you are making headway.

Looking at the week view on my calandar I'm hoping to see a preponderance of blue especially against the slots that I've allotted to my main categories (billable work, business building, exercise, sleep - yes theer's a reminder for that).

Thanks Adam, so much. If anyone has some refinements to add, pls say so. If this works, I'll document it thoroughly and mail it to AD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started a photo-a-day project once, and made it 500 straight days with this technique. I'm so happy I have 500 days of my life documented. Amazing to look back and remember exactly what happened. I used the following website and just made it by homepage. Saw it every day. Good luck. [dontbreakthechain.com]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My best trick to change how I do something is to simply make time for it. Easier said than done, but whatever you plan to do takes up X amount of time. If you don't plan or prepare yourself to use that time, you'll never do it.

Perfect example, I wanted to have more time to read the paper and pack lunches before work. So, instead of getting up 30 minutes before I have to leave, I set my alarm 10 minutes earlier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tend to have to work so everything else has to be done around it.

Set up a simple todo list in conky of things that I need to get sorted but do not have a time limit {unless I add one!}

Daily chores are done on as and when basis

Started home gym a few weeks ago so gradually building up the exercises and will have to fit in some cycling once weather improves...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like this system, because it seems simple enough, yet very effective. I also like how it isn't technology driven. As a young adult I see more and more people try to improve their lives by adding a piece of cumbersome technology that in the end does more harm than good.

As of right now, my only organization of tasks is sticky notes that I create on my phone. I like forming lists out of goals. I can't wait to start creating my chain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For portability, I prefer an app like Goal Master (free, but no longer in development), which lets you set and track daily or weekly habits, and view charts of your compliance rate. It works like an offline version of Joe's Goals. You don't get the persistent visibility of a wall calendar, but you're not rooted to one venue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You people spend so much time analyzing the minutia of a productivity idea and finding "the right software" you never end up actually doing the thing that's supposed to make you more productive. Just go do it, who cares what computer program you use to keep track of it?!?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll admit that having a visual marker for how long you've been doing something does help.

Recently I've been working on diet and exercise, and since keeping track daily of everything on my iphone I've noticed that things actually have been going better than any previous attempt. So yeah, visually keeping track of things you want to improve on does help. Can't say I've had any success in doing anything like this before I started tracking it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joe's Goals, which I believe was the winner of a recent Hive Five, does something similar. I use it for exercise primarily, and it's so effective. Somehow the desire to see that little check mark in every column manages to keep me motivated. It's a terrible feeling to have a gap!

I'm telling you guys, if the idea of "Don't Break the Chain" sounds good to you, but you find it a little inflexible for reality, you really need to look into [beeminder.com]. Since discovering it last month, I've truly become addicted. I've used it to increase my fruit/veggie intake, track my weight loss, keep a (more) regular study pace... Heck, just take a look at my goals page: [www.beeminder.com]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i did well with a New Year's resolution that i phrased as "i haven't drank any sodas since New Years". i could say it only for as long as it held true.

You could skip having one calendar per goal by using a different strokes (to move the world) to indicate the task is done

I don't think the secret to this is getting you to do something specific, but rather getting you to do something *instead of* some other mundane task you would normally do by rote, like reading email, scanning your FB page, or (ironically) reading blogs. In other words, it's nothing more than a simple plan.

It works.

Big fan of lists. I use it at work - 5 things I need to get done at the end of the day > Home - Exercise for an hour 6 times a week, cook dinner, home work with the kids > I do most of my cleaning areas during the weekend. I make sure I have 1 wood wroking project every other week. Keeps me sane

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glad you found something that works! I made a system based on this idea: [www.habitspark.com] Also, specifically for cleaning in about 15 min a day, I've always loved [www.flylady.net]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you can't get it all done now just wait til you have a spouse and kids. Kids in particular have a way of eating up all your time, and having you do their things, at their pace, when they want. Enjoy life now!

Funny enough, I wrote a quick post about an app to help you with this a while back...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not bad. In my experience as an inveterate proscrasinator, well, I'll spell check this and get around to sharing the one, critical secret to productivity maybe in my next post

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should do a Cross Post / Endorsement with the Freakonomics Blog as they're frequently writing about "committment Devices" which is what this really is.

I use a variant of that which is to not break a pattern, if i train on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays then the space between days is noticeable if it gets broken

Daily Goals for iOS is a pretty good don't break the chain app! You can list up to 8 daily goals and tick off the ones you've completed, the calendar view lets you scroll through months and see your chains

I've tried this - many times. The trouble is, I am very easily discouraged. As soon as I miss a day, I think "Oh well, I'll already ruined it - might as well skip tomorrow, too. The chain's broken, right? Who cares when - or if - I start it up again?"

And it doesn't help to say "All you have to do is [this tiny thing]" because when I fail that turns into, "You can't do anything, you useless [expletive deleted]. You can't even do one tiny thing reliably."

This is probably a great tool for people who are, you know, real people who can do stuff. For me, though, it turns into just another opportunity to fail, and then beat myself up about it. Thanks, but I've got plenty of those already.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for the extensive article! I've tried a number of tools and ideas on paper and in digital. Currently i'm using peakpony (https://peakpony.com) and it works very similar to what you're describing.

It is only missing something that helps you not to become demotivated once you've broken the chain - but it can show you your performance over time, and i really like that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've done that for my exercising already. But since my workouts are too big to get them in every evening, I've got my streak with 3 times a week. It's more flexible and if you really can't get it in the one day, go the next day. But there is one iron rule. Go 3 times a week. When I'm ill, I'll compensate the next week or two. I'm now at the end of the year already and when I've finished the 3*52 workouts this year, I'll be pretty happy!
I'm was also impressed by the ease the "don't break the streak" brings in. For me, there is just no way to not go to do my workout anymore. It's simple prohibited.

Works gread for me :)

# Jerry Seinfeld's Productivity Secret #

Years ago when Seinfeld was a new television show, Jerry Seinfeld was still a touring comic. At the time, I was hanging around clubs doing open mic nights and trying to learn the ropes. One night I was in the club where Seinfeld was working, and before he went on stage, I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would benefit me a lifetime...

He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to *write every day*. But his advice was better than that. He had a gem of a leverage technique he used on himself and you can use it to motivate yourself—even when you don't feel like it.

He revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write. Here's how it works.

He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.

He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."

"Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.

Over the years I've used his technique in many different areas. I've used it for exercise, to learn programming, to learn network administration, to build successful websites and build successful businesses.

It works because it isn't the one-shot pushes that get us where we want to go, it is *the consistent daily action that builds extraordinary outcomes*. You may have heard "inch by inch anything's a cinch." Inch by inch does work if you can move an inch every day.

Daily action builds habits. It gives you practice and will make you an expert in a short time. If you don't break the chain, you'll start to spot opportunities you otherwise wouldn't. Small improvements accumulate into large improvements rapidly because daily action provides "compounding interest."

Skipping one day makes it easier to skip the next.

I've often said I'd rather have someone who will take action—even if small—every day as opposed to someone who swings hard once or twice a week. Seinfeld understands that daily action yields greater benefits than sitting down and trying to knock out 1000 jokes in one day.

Think for a moment about what action would make the most profound impact on your life if you worked it every day. That is the action I recommend you put on your Seinfeld calendar. Start today and earn your big red X. And from here on out...

Don't break the chain!

Excellent! I am thinking of modification though. Perhaps to create four small dotted boxes or one large and three small to "X" off. This would represent three or four major tasks or activities, which is probably the most we can get done in any particular day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three years ago today, I stumbled across this article and started a Cisco study chain to earn the CCNA and advance my networking career. So, on this pseudo-anniversary: Thank you, Brad Isaac for writing this article and sharing this productivity secret. Thank you very much!

This motivates me to use this technique.

Thanks to both of you.

@sebi: I realize I'm extremely late, but your site rocks! I wish I found it earlier. I've been using paper or obscure PC/mobile applications that I'll never be able to sync.

If only it was a little more mobile friendly.

@sebi: Also, in case you are reading this (I could not for the life of me find a way to contact you outside of this comment), please make it possible to change the first day of the week!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used a similar technique over the years to do everything from quitting drugs and alcohol to establishing an exercise program. The only difference is that I used a monthly calendar and instead of crossing off each day I wrote the number of days in a row I had been successful. Seeing those numbers grow is a huge motivation to keep them growing.

Just make sure that whatever technique you use, the calendar is in plain sight (moving it once a week to a new, equally obvious spot can help too if you tend to ignore things after a while). The other technique that works well (which is why AA uses it) is to share your results with a friend or support partner on a regular basis. That added accountability can provide an additional motivation to keep at it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This really is a great and simple idea. The leaning styles link from a couple of days ago told me what I already, knew: I'm a visual learner/worker/etc... Being able to look up and see effort and progress being should be a powerful motivator. Thanks for sharing this one!

Interesting tip, and I'd probably be surprised to hear it coming from Seinfeld, if I hadn't watched his documentary "Comedian." One of the things I found interesting about that movie was the immense amount of preparation he puts into a standup routine. He tells the same jokes over and over, honing them until he thinks they work just right.

It's not that I ever thought doing standup was easy; I just imagined it as one of those things where, if you have the talent, it comes naturally. I guess the movie was an illustration of the truism that people who are really good at something make it look much easier than it is.

so simple. so effective. I live by reminders. In outlook, on the cell, from the wife. None of these seem to fully work.

Here's another tip. Not sure if I found this through here or elsewhere: [www.marthastewart.com]

It's a chalkboard wall calendar. I'm in the process of building the new office. Once the walls are up, this will be directly across from my desk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This came at a perfect time for me also, sometimes the grind of consistency can wear on us and burn us out. The quote below was more than worth my time to remind me that nothing really good has come from life without consistency and hard work. "because it isn't the one-shot pushes that get us where we want to go, it is the consistent daily action that builds extraordinary outcomes."

BTW Why would you run out and buy a calendar when you can just print one...

@Jarick and others, another thought. It's ideal to put the calendar in a prominent place - where you can't help but see it - preferably all day.

Idea: the wall behind where your computer monitor is so when you look off into the distance you see the calendar and the chain. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It stirkes me that this technique is one that most elem. school teachers use. Remember large poster boards on one side of the room with everybodys name down the side, then rows of star stickers for various thing. Things like attendance or homework.

Another thought, if you were doing a few different tasks, using mulitple colors. Myself, I'm trying to be a writer, and maybe loose a few pounds. I'd have red for exercise, and orange for writing. Knowing myself, I'd come up with other things to do, just so I'd have a little rainbow on my calender, each and everyday.

	
# Practice Multiple Skills at a Time Instead of Focusing on One for Greater Results #

Author: Adam Pash

Wired's Garth Sundem sat down with the Robert Bjork, director of UCLA's Learning and Forgetting Lab, to discuss how you can best "[pack] things in your brain in a way that keeps them from leaking out". What he learned? *A lot of our basic assumptions are wrong*.

For example, rather than blocking out chunks of time to focus on improving one skill or subject, Bjork says you're much better off by interleaving skill sets. As an example, Sundem explains that if you're trying to improve your tennis serve, you're better off working to improve your entire game than focusing specifically on your serve:

Instead of making an appreciable leap forward with your serving ability after a session of focused practice, interleaving forces you to make nearly imperceptible steps forward with many skills. But over time, the sum of these small steps is much greater than the sum of the leaps you would have taken if you'd spent the same amount of time mastering each skill in its turn.

Bjork explains that successful interleaving allows you to "seat" each skill among the others. "If information is studied so that it can be interpreted in relation to other things in memory, learning is much more powerful," he said. There's one caveat: Make sure the mini skills you interleave are related in some higher-order way. If you're trying to learn tennis, you'd want to interleave serves, backhands, volleys, smashes, and footwork - not serves, synchronized swimming, European capitals, and programming in Java.

Check out the full post over at Wired's GeekDad, which also clears the air on a few other common learning misconceptions.
